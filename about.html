      <h3>DOKIMOS</h3>
      <p>We are the Maverick Christians.  We follow Jesus, not an institution.  We fellowship amongst local bodies of believers and are not bound by legalism, man-made rules, nor denominationalism.  Sometimes we gather in homes or other places. We maintain the right, as believers in Jesus, to freely understand the Holy Bible for ourselves. Maverick Christians are not a denomination. We are an unbranded movement of believers in Jesus Christ, led by the Holy Bible as Godâ€™s word and led by the Holy Spirit. We follow the Lord not bound by creed and have the tendency to resist the controls of religious institutions.

		<h3>MISSION</h3>
 		<h3><img src="images/mission.jpg" alt="" class="missionimg"/><br></h3>
		
      <p id="aboutmission">We think freely as individuals in the mind of Christ.  Mavericks are not loners but come together in herds.  We gather in homes, church buildings, or other locations when and where we do as we follow our great Shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ. We want to share thoughts without brands.</p>

       <article class="footer_column_beliefs"> <h3>OUR BELIEFS</h3>
 		<h3> <img src="images/scriptures.jpg" alt="" class="missionimg"/></h3>
          
      <p id="aboutbelief">There are those of us who do not feel bound to worship together on particular days.  It might not be easy for us to feel settled or at home in many churches.  Nonetheless, we are all Maverick Christians and have learned to recognize each other in our love and zeal for God wherever we go.  As Christians, we have various levels of commitment to Christ and with other believers as we grow in the faith, grace, and knowledge of our Lord. Those who lead among us do so by their example, not by lordship, as the Bible shows ought to be.
